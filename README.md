A pixel art construction plan generator

Download links can be found in releases. 

This tool needs a large amount of RAM to perform calculations, but it cannot process plans that has raw size of more than 2GB. 
Please have at least 4GB of available RAM before trying to create large construction plans. 

Currently, there is only one blocks database, if you can provide others (for Trove or other relevant games), 
please let me know. 

This software is built with Visual Studio 2017. 

Please open an issue if there is something you want me to know.
